# Head Home


A website providing information and resources related to homelessness and mental health. Resources focus on the Twin Cities Metro Area and can be searched by the type and city of the resource.

It combinines the final projects of three classes from my Master of Library and Information Science:
* LIS 7510: Database Management (the SQL, coauthored by L. Bastyr)
* LIS 7963: Advanced Databases (the PHP)
* LIS 7530: Internet Fundamentals & Design (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
