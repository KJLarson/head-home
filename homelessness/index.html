            <h2>Myths and Facts About Homelessness</h2>

            <p>
                There are many myths, or false ideas, about homelessness. Many of them are damaging to people who are experiencing homelessness and society in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are some of the common myths. Click on each one to see the true answer. Click on the myth again to hide the truth.

            <button class="accordion"><b>Myth:</b> People choose to be homeless</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><b>Truth:</b></p>
                <p>
                    Nobody has a goal of being homeless. People are homeless for a wide variety of reasons, many of which are at least partly and often largely beyond a personâ€™s control. Yes, poor choices can contribute to homelessness. But outside
                    circumstances strongly influence those choices.

                <p><b>Truth:</b></p>
                <p>
                    Once a person or family loses their home, it is very difficult to get back into housing. Most people lose their housing because of financial issues.Getting a job without an address, phone number, shower, or clean clothes is very
                    challenging. Other things that can add to difficulties getting out of homelessness include health problems, legal issues, and lack of transportation. People who are homeless don't want to stay homeless, though some might give up
                    trying
                    to find housing after they aren't able to access services after months or years of trying.

            <button class="accordion"><b>Myth:</b> Most homeless people are addicted to drugs or alcohol</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><b>Truth:</b></p>
                <p>
                    Many homeless people report having substance abuse issues, but most say the problem started <em>after</em> losing their housing and was not the cause of their homelessness. It is common for people to begin using drugs and alcohol in
                    order to escape the difficulties of being homeless. Some people are able to stop their addiction when they find stable housing, as they no longer need it to cope.

            <button class="accordion"><b>Myth:</b> Homeless people just need to get a job</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><b>Truth:</b></p>
                <p>
                    Getting a job is very difficult for a homeless person, as many do not have access to a shower, clean clothes, transportation, or a permanent addess or phone number. Some people may have additional barriers, like a criminal past,
                    disabilities, or a lack of education. Sometimes, even when a person does have income from a job, disability, and/or VA benefits it is not enough to afford housing.

                <p>
                    Living on the street is a lot of work. It can take all day to find food or travel to another part of the city. A homeless person must also protect their belongings while they do anything because they usually do not have a secure
                    place to
                    lock stuff up. All this is often done while being sleep deprived, cold, and/or hungry.

            <button class="accordion"><b>Myth:</b> Homelessness will never happen to me</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><b>Truth:</b></p>
                <p>
                    It only takes one event to put someone in a situation where they can no longer afford housing. Many homeless people have had solid jobs and families. Even people who are financially secure can lose their home after one or more
                    unfortunate events.
