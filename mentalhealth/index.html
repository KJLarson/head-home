            <h2>Mental Health vs. Mental Illness</h2>
            <p>
                What is the different between mental health and mental illness? Even though people often use the two terms in the same way, there is actually a difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mental health involves the overall well-being of a person, including emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Are your thoughts good or bad? What is your level of happiness? Of fulfillment?
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone has mental health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mental illness refers to a recognized, diagnosed disorder. A qualified medical professional must compare a person's symptoms with a list of conditions for each syndrome or illness and determine if they meet the requirements for diagnosis. After this, the medical professional can recomment treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not everyone has a diagnosable mental illness.
